# Itunes-Team-Seis
Weekly Front End Project

This a app that uses the Itunes database to populate different pages with music based on a search. 
Using Vanilla Javascript we created an API to pull directly from the Itunes API. 
The Api pulls the dat and populates the webpage manipulating the DOM. 
You can view the page here http://ocho-tunes.surge.sh/
